The plot illustrates the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for solving
homicides comparing male victims to female victims across different
cities. Most cities cluster around an OR of 1, indicating little
difference in the likelihood of solving homicides based on the victim’s
sex. However, some cities show ORs significantly greater than 1,
suggesting that male victims’ cases are more likely to be solved than
those of female victims, while others have ORs less than 1, implying the
opposite. Cities with wide confidence intervals reflect high
uncertainty. In contrast, cities with narrow intervals likely have more
reliable estimates. A few cities stand out as outliers with notably high
or low ORs, which could indicate unique factors affecting case
resolution. Additionally, confidence intervals crossing 1 suggest no
statistically significant difference in some cities, even if their ORs
deviate from 1. Overall, the plot highlights disparities in how victim
sex may influence case outcomes, underscoring the need for further
investigation into the underlying causes in cities with extreme or
unusual trends.

The modeling process began with proposing a regression model for
predicting birthweight based on biologically relevant factors, including
gestational age, maternal characteristics (e.g., pre-pregnancy BMI,
weight gain, smoking habits, and race), and baby-specific factors (e.g.,
sex and presence of malformations). This proposed model was developed
based on both domain knowledge and hypothesized relationships affecting
birthweight. To compare its performance, two alternative models were
introduced: one using length at birth and gestational age as predictors
(main effects only) and another incorporating head circumference,
length, sex, and all two-way and three-way interactions between these
variables. Monte Carlo cross-validation was used to evaluate model
performance, with 100 random train-test splits generated to ensure
robust results. Each model was fitted on the training data, and RMSE
(root mean square error) was computed on the test data to assess
prediction accuracy. Finally, the residuals of the proposed model were
plotted against fitted values to check for assumptions of linearity,
homoscedasticity, and absence of patterns, ensuring the validity of the
model. This comprehensive process allowed for a thorough evaluation and
comparison of predictive performance across all models.

The results of the model comparison indicate distinct differences in
predictive performance. The RMSE distribution across models reveals that
Model 2, which incorporates head circumference, length at birth, sex,
and all interactions, achieves the lowest RMSE, suggesting it provides
the most accurate and consistent predictions. Model 1, which includes
only length at birth and gestational age as predictors, performs
moderately well with a narrower RMSE distribution but does not achieve
the same level of accuracy as Model 2. The proposed model, which
incorporates gestational age, maternal characteristics (e.g.,
pre-pregnancy BMI, weight gain, smoking status), and baby-specific
factors (e.g., sex and malformations), has the highest RMSE and
underperforms compared to the other models, likely due to its inability
to capture more complex interactions and relationships.

The residual plot for the proposed model shows generally random scatter
around zero, indicating that the model assumptions of linearity and
homoscedasticity are reasonably met. However, the presence of some
larger residuals points to potential outliers that may influence the
model’s performance. While the proposed model aligns well with
biological reasoning and offers interpretability, its relatively higher
RMSE indicates it is less effective at predicting birthweight compared
to Model 2. Overall, Model 2 is the preferred choice for predictive
accuracy, whereas the proposed model may still be useful for
interpretative analysis due to its simplicity and grounding in
hypothesized factors.
